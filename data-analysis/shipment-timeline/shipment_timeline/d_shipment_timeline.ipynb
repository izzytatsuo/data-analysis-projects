    "## Shipment Timeline Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The shipment timeline data model brings together data from three primary sources, stacking events to create a comprehensive timeline view of package movement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **slam_leg** - Shipment legs from SLAM (Sort, Label, and Manifest) system\n",
    "2. **gmp** - GMP (Global Marketplace Platform) shipment tracking events\n",
    "3. **pse** - Package Systems Events \n",
    "4. **nc_load_summary_snapshot** - Vehicle routing data\n",
    "5. **node_type** - Location type reference data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Design Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UNION ALL Structure**: Each event remains a separate row, stacked from different source systems\n",
    "- **Data Filtering**:\n",
    "  - Only includes GMP records with matching shipment_key in slam_leg\n",
    "  - Only includes PSE records with matching tracking_id in GMP that matches slam_leg\n",
    "  - This ensures we're only analyzing volume that's included in the slam_leg data\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Common Key Fields**: \n",
    "  - `pk`: Common identifier (shipment_key or tracking_id) to track an item across systems\n",
    "  - `source_table`: Identifies which system the record came from ('slam_leg', 'GMP', or 'PSE')\n",
    "  - `event_timestamp`: Normalized timestamp from different source fields\n",
    "  - `shipment_id`, `package_id`, `tracking_id`, `dw_created_time`: Normalized across sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location Type Mapping**:\n",
    "  - Join with `node_type` for each location type (origin, status_node, destination)\n",
    "  - Enhances data with location type information for richer analysis\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Status Identification**:\n",
    "  - Events can be classified in queries using CASE statements based on source_table, ship_track_event_code, and state_status\n",
    "  - Allows for consistent status tracking across the entire shipment journey\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SORTKEY(pk, event_timestamp)**: Improves query performance for filtering and ordering by package and time\n",
    "- **DISTKEY(pk)**: Distributes data efficiently across Redshift nodes by package identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tracking a package's complete journey chronologically across multiple systems\n",
    "2. Analyzing delivery performance metrics and time between key events\n",
    "3. Identifying where packages may be getting delayed or lost\n",
    "4. Creating comprehensive timelines of shipment events\n",
    "5. Analyzing status transitions and time between key events\n",
    "6. Correlating shipment events with vehicle routing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Modeling Approach: UNION ALL vs JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses a UNION ALL approach rather than a JOIN approach. Here's how they compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UNION ALL Approach (Current Implementation)\n",
    "- **Structure**: Events remain as separate rows, stacked vertically\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Better for timeline analysis and event sequencing\n",
    "  - Natural fit for tracking status transitions over time\n",
    "  - Follows pattern used in waterfall_reference.sql\n",
    "- **Considerations**:\n",
    "  - More rows with sparse data (many NULL fields)\n",
    "  - May use more storage due to NULLs for fields from other source tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JOIN Approach (Alternative)\n",
    "- **Structure**: Events from different sources combined into wide rows with many columns\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Better for retrieving all information about a package in a single row\n",
    "  - May use less storage if there are many events per package\n",
    "  - Potentially faster for queries that need all attributes at once\n",
    "- **Considerations**:\n",
    "  - More complex to analyze event sequences\n",
    "  - JOIN operations can be expensive with large datasets\n",
    "  - May duplicate events across joined rows\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNION ALL approach was selected because it better supports the event timeline analysis needed for tracking package movement through the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example queries below demonstrate how to extract useful insights from this timeline view."
