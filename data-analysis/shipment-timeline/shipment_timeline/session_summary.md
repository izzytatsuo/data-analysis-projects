# Shipment Timeline & Container Planning Analysis Session Summary

## Session Overview

In this comprehensive session, we developed a robust framework for analyzing container planning data across delivery stations, with a specific focus on understanding "no-cycle" patterns (packages that are inducted without planning). The work included creating Python analysis tools, SQL queries, and documentation that supports ongoing analysis of planning effectiveness.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure and Analysis

- **Initial Project Exploration**: Reviewed the shipment timeline project structure, which focuses on tracking packages through SLAM, GMP, and PSE systems
- **Container Planning Addition**: Extended the project to include container planning data analysis for planning effectiveness
- **Integrated Analysis Framework**: Created a comprehensive approach that combines timeline data with container planning metrics

### 2. Container Planning Data Analysis

- **Data Source Identification**: Located and analyzed container planning data in S3 parquet files for multiple stations (DAU1, DJT6)
- **Station Comparison**: Conducted comparative analysis between stations, revealing significant differences in planning effectiveness:
  - DAU1: 100% planned, 95% inducted as planned, 6 originating nodes
  - DJT6: 61% planned, 56% inducted as planned, 13 originating nodes, more variability

### 3. Tool Development

- **Analysis Script**: Created a Python script (`analyze_parquet.py`) to examine parquet data structure and contents
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Developed a comprehensive notebook (`container_analysis.ipynb`) with visualization capabilities
- **Shell Scripts**: Created companion shell scripts to facilitate parquet data retrieval and analysis
- **Excel File Reader**: Created a utility script for reading Excel files (`view_excel.py`)

### 4. SQL Query Development

- **Base Analysis Queries**: Crafted core queries for daily container planning metrics
- **Aggregation Techniques**: Implemented weekly and monthly aggregation patterns
- **Volatility Measurement**: Added standard deviation calculations to measure planning stability
- **Performance Optimization**: Created temp table approach for efficient multiple aggregations
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Implemented date component extraction for flexible time-based analysis
- **Location-Aware Processing**: Integrated timezone handling via location mapping table

### 5. Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md**: Created comprehensive documentation of analysis techniques and best practices
- **README.md**: Added documentation for container planning analysis tools
- **Comments**: Added detailed comments to SQL and Python code for maintainability

## Detailed Analysis Findings

### Planning Effectiveness Patterns

The comparative analysis between stations revealed distinct patterns in planning effectiveness:

1. **DAU1 Station (June 3)**:
   - Near-perfect planning execution (100% planned, 95% inducted as planned)
   - Consistent timing between planning and execution
   - Limited originating node diversity (6 nodes)
   - Stable process patterns

2. **DJT6 Station (June 2)**:
   - Significant planning challenges (61% planned, 56% inducted as planned)
   - Higher variance in timing between planning and execution
   - Greater originating node diversity (13 nodes)
   - More variable process patterns

### Analytical Approach Innovations

1. **Temp Table for Base Calculations**: Created a workflow that first establishes a temp table with base metrics for efficient further analysis
2. **Volatility Metrics**: Implemented standard deviation calculations to quantify planning stability
3. **Date Component Extraction**: Separated date components (year, month, week) for flexible aggregation
4. **Volume Filtering**: Added minimum volume thresholds to prevent skewed results from low-volume periods
5. **Volume-Weighted Analysis**: Created techniques to weight metrics by volume for more accurate regional comparisons

## Technical Implementation Details

### Python Analysis Framework

```python
def analyze_parquet(file_path):
    """
    Analyze a parquet file and print its schema and sample data.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the parquet file
    """
    # Read the parquet file
    parquet_file = pq.read_table(file_path)
    df = parquet_file.to_pandas()
    
    # Print schema and sample data
    print("\nSchema:")
    for col in parquet_file.schema:
        print(f"- {col.name}: {col.type}")
    
    # Calculate statistics
    print(f"\nTotal rows: {len(df)}")
    print(f"Unique originating nodes: {df['originating_node'].nunique()}")
    print(f"Planned packages: {df['is_planned'].sum()}")
    print(f"Inducted packages: {df['is_inducted'].sum()}")
    print(f"Inducted as planned: {df['is_inducted_as_planned'].sum()}")
```

### SQL Analysis Framework

```sql
-- Create a temporary table with base calculations
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_data (
    date DATE,
    station_code TEXT,
    is_planned INT,
    is_inducted INT,
    is_inducted_as_planned INT,
    is_planned_not_inducted INT,
    is_inducted_not_planned INT,
    pct_inducted_not_planned NUMERIC
) ON COMMIT DROP;

-- Perform aggregations on the base data
WITH monthly_data AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_PART('year', date) AS year,
        DATE_PART('month', date) AS month,
        DATE_PART('week', date) AS week_of_year,
        station_code,
        SUM(is_inducted) AS inducted_volume,
        SUM(is_inducted_not_planned) AS inducted_not_planned
    FROM temp_data
    GROUP BY year, month, week_of_year, station_code
)
-- Further analysis on aggregated data
```

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Expand Analysis Scope**:
   - Analyze more stations to identify patterns and best practices
   - Extend time range to understand seasonal variations
   - Integrate more originating node data for upstream analysis

2. **Visualization Development**:
   - Create dashboards for monitoring planning effectiveness
   - Implement time-series visualizations to track trends
   - Add drill-down capabilities for root cause analysis

3. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Implement anomaly detection for unusual no-cycle patterns
   - Develop predictive models for planning effectiveness
   - Create auto-alerting for stations with declining metrics

4. **Integration Opportunities**:
   - Connect container planning data with the core shipment timeline
   - Develop unified queries across all data sources
   - Create end-to-end package tracking with planning context
